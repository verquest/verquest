## [Unreleased]

### Breaking Changes
- **BREAKING:** Switching to slash notation for mapping to improve consistency with how properties are referenced in JSON Schema. Before: `example.nested.property`, now: `example/nested/property`.

### New Features
- Add support for inverted mapping, that can be used to map internal structure to external representation (e.g., for errors). ([#10](https://github.com/CiTroNaK/verquest/pull/10), [@CiTroNaK](https://github.com/CiTroNaK))
- Add support for constants in the schema, allowing to define fixed values for properties. ([#11](https://github.com/CiTroNaK/verquest/pull/11), [@CiTroNaK](https://github.com/CiTroNaK))
